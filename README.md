Step 1: ​ Download the world-happiness dataset from Kaggle.com from https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

Step 2: ​ Download the world development indicators data from ​https://databank.worldbank.org

	b) Bring Development Indicators data into the format Country Name, Year, Indicator 1 Value, Ind 2 Value, .... Ind 35 Value
